# zoo-moo

A 4 player versus game developed for an alternate controller, and demoed at the 'State of Play' game convention. 

The game is played with each player screaming 'Moo' into their singstar mic in order to launch their sumo cow forward into other players, trying to knock them off the ring. The louder the moo, the greater the force! Turn your cow by twisting the cardboard cow head gadget attached to the mic.
